With a daunting shift from mechanical engineering to web development, I initiated my career as an entry-level Front End Developer in early 2017. I have worked on numerous projects, including different tech stacks from that point on.

I am a self taught developer with 4+ years of experience in creating and delivering user-centric application and solutions, I have been acknowledged as a solution-focused professional with the ability to design and develop innovative applications.
