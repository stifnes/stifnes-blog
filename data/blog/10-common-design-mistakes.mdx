The following blog will contain the 2 Most Common Web Design Mistakes

## Low Contrast or tiny text

Low contrast and small text are poor design choices because they can make text challenging to read and comprehend, which can ruin the user experience. It can be challenging for the eyes to distinguish the text from the background when there is insufficient contrast, especially for those who have visual impairments or are reading in low light.

Similar to this, reading text that is too small can be challenging, especially for those who have vision issues or are using small screens. Users may find it challenging to interact with the content, such as clicking links or buttons, when the text is small.

These design errors may make it difficult for users to interact with and comprehend the content, which may cause frustration and ultimately lead to a bad user experience. It's crucial to check that the text and background contrast is adequate and that the text is readable and large enough for users to easily read.

## Design mistake of mobile design on big screens

The design mistake of mobile design on big screens is that it can result in a poor user experience for users on larger screens. Mobile designs are optimized for smaller screens and have different design considerations compared to desktop or larger screens. When mobile design is used on big screens, the content can appear stretched, the text can be too small, and the layout can look unbalanced.

One common issue with mobile design on big screens is that it often results in a lack of white space or negative space. Mobile designs are typically more compact and efficient with space, but when they are stretched out to larger screens, they can look cluttered and overwhelming. This can make it challenging for users to navigate the content and can result in a confusing user experience.

Another issue with mobile design on big screens is that the navigation may not be optimized for larger screens. For example, if a mobile menu is used on a larger screen, it can look too small and be difficult to interact with. This can result in a frustrating user experience, where users have to spend more time trying to navigate the content than actually engaging with it.

To avoid this design mistake, it's important to consider the context and screen size when designing for mobile. Responsive design, which adjusts the layout and design based on the screen size, can help ensure that the user experience is optimized for all devices. Additionally, designers should focus on providing ample white space, using appropriate font sizes, and optimizing the navigation for larger screens.
