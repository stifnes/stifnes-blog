The following blog will contain the 2 Most Common Web Design Mistakes

## Low Contrast or tiny text

Low contrast and small text are poor design choices because they can make text challenging to read and comprehend, which can ruin the user experience.
It can be challenging for the eyes to distinguish the text from the background when there is insufficient contrast, especially for those who have visual impairments or are reading in low light.

Reading too small text can be very challenging, especially for the people who have vision impairment or are using the website/application of smaller screens. Users will find it challenging to interact with elements such as clicking on buttons or icons.

These design errors make it difficult for the user to understand content and ultimately cause frustration which leads to an overall bad user experience. There are plenty of online tools such as https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/ to check that the text and background contrast meet the requirements and everything on the website is readable.

## Design mistake of mobile design on big screens

Mobile designs are only optimized for smaller screens. Implementing them for big screens will result in poor user experience. Mobile and responsive design have specific design considerations as compared to desktop or larger screens. Content appears to be stretched out, the text could be too small and layout will look unbalanced if mobile design is displayed on bigger screens.

There is a concept of white space also known as negative space which is the empty space around the content and functional elements of a page. The main role of which is to let the design appear breathable by reducing the text and functional elements that users see in one glance. A common issue with mobile design on large screen is that it lacks this white space. Since mobile designs are typically compact and efficient with space, they can look cluttered when stretched out over large screens.

Another issue of mobile design on large screens is navigation between different screens and elements. Menu and buttons are usually made small for mobile, using appropriate font sizes and spacing. They can be difficult to interact with if they appear small even on bigger screens.

Therefore it is important to keep the design optimized for every breakpoint. The design should be responsive for larger and smaller screens.
