Two Observations from the article https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/wireframe-prototype-difference/

Wireframe and prototype are frequently conflated by individuals, even designers. They are aware that both are a product of the design process, but are confused to whether their forms and functions are comparable in some ways.

# Wireframing

A wireframe is a `low-fidelity` mockup that accomplishes three clear and concise goals:

- It displays the data that will be shown on the page.
- It provides a description of the page's structure and layout.
- It communicates the user interface's overarching direction and description.

# Prototyping

A prototype is a basic, straightforward working version of an application or website. After wireframing, they are often the following step in the product design process. Color, animations, and ideally the actual content that will be on or in your product can all be found in prototypes.

# Difference between wireframe and Prototyping

Wireframes serve as the skeleton of your digital product. They’re the base, and they provide a general idea of
the construction of what you’re building. Beyond the layout skeleton of the design, the content and copy is the muscle of
the product. The earlier you have the content and copy for your design, the clearer the path will be from wireframe to prototype.
It’s helpful to have the actual content in place to make sure everything flows the way you want.

Prototypes are a more visual representation of your product. Think of a prototypes as nearly formed bodies with
moldable skin or facial features. Drafting a prototype is like making your creation suitable for the public. It’s not the
final version, but it’s acceptable to show to other people. This is the point where all you should need to do is make tiny
tweaks before you send your designs over to the engineers who’ll make it real.
