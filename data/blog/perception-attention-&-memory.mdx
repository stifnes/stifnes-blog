- Gestalt principle can be used in interaction design in many ways
  - The color contrast must be in similarity towards one another, they must belong to one group
  - Closures are an auto generated image of something in our head even if they are not there. Popup elements are not actually popping out from the webpage but they can be design in closure to the actual web page
  - Banners and Headers are a good example of Continuity. Any objects which are aligned on a single line of action can be said to be in continuity.
  - Filters on the left hand side of an e-commerce website are all in proximity of each other so they are expected to perform similar functionality.

## Testing attention & working memory

- This can be applied to user attention to one thing at a time. If there is a lot of cluster in the design user will not be able to focus on the main idea.
