The following blog will tell how to use colspan and rowspan in tables. Also some positive and negative aspects of using tables

To understand colspan in tables. Start by creating a simple table with two rows and 5 cells like this:

```
<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>3</td>
    </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>5</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

Then add some styles to visualize each cell:

```
table {
  border: 1px solid;
  width: 200px;
  height: 150px;
  text-align:center
}

td {
  border: 1px solid red
}
```

Run your HTML in the browser and it must look something like this:

![Table colspan](/static/images/colspan.png)

Now to make the last cell span over two columns so that it takes the empty space on the right, add an attribute of `colspan="2"` on the last `td` element:

```
<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>3</td>
    </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>4</td>
      <td colspan="2">5</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

And now you should see your last cells spanned over 2 columns and occupies the empty space on the right. Like this:

![Table colspan final](/static/images/colspan-2.png)

And thats how colspan works.

Now lets look at row span. A key point to remember here is that `colspan` spans a cell in horizontal axes and `rowspan` spans the cell in vertical axes. Lets take a look:

Take the same table from above and add another cell to the second row and also add another row with two cells after it

```
<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>3</td>
    </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>6</td>
    </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>7</td>
      <td>8</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

![Table rowspan](/static/images/rowspan.png)

Now add an attribute of `rowspan="2"` to the sixt cell to span it down over the empty space.

```
<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>3</td>
    </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>5</td>
      <td rowspan="2">6</td>
    </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>7</td>
      <td>8</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

And now you can see the 6th cell spanned in vertical direction over two rows

Some positives and negatives about `tables` in HTML.

## Positives:

- Tables are a great tool for displaying large number of tabular data such as spreadsheets and finances in admin panels and stock exchange websites.

## Negatives:

- Coding Tables can be tricky, especially if you are dealing with nested tables
- Tables are not responsive. It is very hard to transform a table for mobile screen size
- Although it is easier to make elements centralized in table cells. Making entire layouts using tables can be complex. It is easier to make layouts using flexbox and CSS Grids
